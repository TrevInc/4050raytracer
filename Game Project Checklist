Game Behavior Checklist

Start 3 lives and 0 points
Touch Signaled Ball to get pts
15 pts = Extra life
Touch Wrong Ball - die

Game over screen - render w/ high score

[ ] Implement 5 ball types - red, green, yellow, blue, grey
[ ] implement collision with right and wrong ball types
[ ] add symbols to ball sprites for colorblind people (like me!)
[ ] edit scoring rules and implementation
[ ] add target indicator
[ ] edit ball respawn
[ ] make game over screen routine stateful
